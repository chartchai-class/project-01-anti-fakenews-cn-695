## Project Description
### 1. Project Overview
This is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed with React + TypeScript + Vite, designed to identify fake news through collective user wisdom. Users can submit news, vote on its authenticity, post comments with supporting evidence, and the system labels news status based on voting results. It supports multi-dimensional filtering and paginated browsing.

### 2. Core Features
- **News List Page**: Displays key news information (title, summary, status, etc.), supports filtering by "All/Fake/Non-Fake" news, and allows users to customize the number of news items per page.
- **News Detail Page**: Shows complete news content and images (in URL link format), provides voting and commenting functions, and supports pagination for comments and voting results.
- **Data Storage**: Temporarily stores voting and comment data via front-end storage (data may be lost after page refresh), no back-end API required.
- **Mock Data**: Built-in sufficient mock news data to fully demonstrate pagination and filtering effects.

### 3. Technology Stack
- Core Framework: React + TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite
- Deployment Platform: Vercel
- Other Dependencies: [Optional, e.g., React Router, Zustand (State Management), etc.]
